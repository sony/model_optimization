    A class to wrap all information about a specific framework the library needs to quantize a model.
    Specifically, FrameworkInfo holds lists of layers by how they should be quantized, and multiple mappings such as
    layer to it kernel channels indices, and a layer to its min/max values, etc.
    The layers lists are divided into three groups:
    kernel_ops: Layers that have coefficients and need to get quantized (e.g., Conv2D, Dense, etc.)
    activation_ops: Layers that their outputs should get quantized (e.g., Add, ReLU, etc.)
    no_quantization_ops:Layers that should not get quantized (e.g., Reshape, Transpose, etc.)

    Fields:
        kernel_channels_mapping (Dict): Dictionary from a layer to a tuple of its kernel in/out channels indices.
        kernel_ops_attribute_mapping (Dict): Dictionary from a framework operator to its weight attribute to quantize.
        out_channel_axis_mapping (Dict): Dictionary of output channels of the model's layers (for computing statistics per-channel).
        _layer_min_max_mapping (Dict[Any, tuple]): Dictionary from a layer to its min/max output values.
        activation_quantizer_factory_mapping: A mapping from QuantizationMethod to a factory function that accepts activation bitwidth and a dict of quantization params, and returns the corresponding quantization function.
