    "# Export a Quantized Pytorch Model With the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to export a PyTorch model to ONNX and TorchSript formats using the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT). It covers the steps of creating a simple PyTorch model, applying post-training quantization (PTQ) using MCT, and then exporting the quantized model to ONNX and TorchSript. The tutorial also shows how to use the exported model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructing a simple PyTorch model for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "2. Applying post-training quantization to the model using the Model Compression Toolkit.\n",
    "3. Exporting the quantized model to the ONNX and TorchScript formats.\n",
    "4. Ensuring compatibility between PyTorch and ONNX during the export process.\n",
    "5. Using the exported model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "To export your quantized model to ONNX format and use it for inference, you will need to install some additional packages. Note that these packages are only required if you plan to export the model to ONNX. If ONNX export is not needed, you can skip this step."
